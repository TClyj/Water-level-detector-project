# Water-level-detector-project

## Project idea

We are going to make a water level alarm and its supporting facility. We will detect the real time
water level by using a water level sensor and output a noise through the speaker while the
output voltage of the water sensor is over the chosen limitation.

For the supporting facility part, a joystick will be used and users can interact with it. The sticker
can control a motor which can open a gate to release the water. However, since the design for a
usable water gate will take many times, our final demonstration may not include this part. Also,
when the output voltage of the water sensor is high, the joystick will have a new function and we
can quickly click the switch in the sticker to make the motor run for 2 seconds.
